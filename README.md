[I. Half Adder](#1)

A half adder is a digital logic circuit that performs binary addition of two single-bit binary numbers. It has two inputs, A and B, and two outputs SUM and Cout. Half adder logic circuits have no memory e.g 1+0; 0+1; 0+0.

**Logical Expression**

*For Sum:*

SUM = A xor B

*For Cout:*

Cout = A and B

Therefore we have the following logic diagram
